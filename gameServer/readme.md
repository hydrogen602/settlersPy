##  On Multiple Inheritance and Arguments in `__init__`

When there is a change of multiple inheritance, `__init__`
should always use only keyword arguments and then pass
the remaining kwargs to `super().__init__`. This
seems like the best way to deal with multiple parents
that all need some argument.

---
## JsonSerializable system

As the necessary data of an object may come from
superclasses as well as the subclass,
every class that has the `toJsonSerializable`
method should inherit from `mapCode.util.JsonSerializable`.
This superclass will ensure that all subclasses have
implemented their own `toJsonSerializable` method
as well as allowing for this pattern:
```
def toJsonSerializable(self) -> Dict[str, object]:
  return {
    'position': self._pos,
    'owner': self._owner,
    **super().toJsonSerializable()
  }
```
Here the class makes a dict with its variables,
but also calls `super().toJsonSerializable()`
so that any of its parents can also add their own
variables to the dictionary.
The `JsonSerializable` class has a `toJsonSerializable`
method that returns an empty dictionary, so that
`super().toJsonSerializable()` can be called without
worrying that none of the parents have the method,
which would cause an exception.

## Websocket Error Codes

4000â€“4999 are for applications by websocket design

I'll use 4000-4099 for errors that should sent the user back to login

- [4000] name missing
- [4001] game already started
- [4002] invalid token
